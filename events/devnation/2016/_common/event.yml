    date: Feb, 09 2016
    abstract:
        In this session, we'll give a live demo of Red Hat Mobile Application Platform, demonstrating the full range of features from client-side coding, to server-side coding, to reusable Mobile Backend-as-a-service (MBaaS) services in Node.js. This will be a bottom-up explanation of the power of the platform, and it's aimed at software developers who have an interest in mobile client-side or server-side development in Node.js.

    date: Nov, 10 2015
    abstract: Scale changes everything. What once was quite adequate for enterprise messaging can't scale to support "Internet of Things". We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of Things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we&rsquo;re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.
    speaker: Langdon White, Red Hat

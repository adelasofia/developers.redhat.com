  - title: "CDK 2.0: Docker, Kubernetes, and OSE on your desk"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m.
    abstract: Scale changes everything. What once was quite adequate for enterprise messaging can't scale to support "Internet of Things". We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of Things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we&rsquo;re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.
    speaker: Langdon White, Red Hat
  - title: "Tracking huge files with Git LFS"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m.
    abstract: Developers love Git for its raw speed, powerful history traversal, distributed nature, and the fact that it was built by uber developer Linus Torvalds. What we don't love is the fact that, out of the box, Git has terrible support for tracking large binary files. Fortunately, developers from Atlassian, GitHub, and Visual Studio Online have teamed up to work on an open source project to solve this problem: Git LFS (Large File Support). This means researchers, web designers, game developers, multimedia producers, and all other developers who need to work with large data and rich media can move off legacy-centralized systems and start using modern version control. In this session, we'll cover the computer science behind Git LFS' internals and architecture, CLI usage, and how to build an effective Git LFS workflow for a development team. You'll leave with an understanding of how Git LFS works under the hood and some practical advice on using Git LFS with your software projects and teams.
    speaker: Tim Pettersen, Senior Developer, Atlassian

    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m.
    abstract: This presentation will take developers behind the scenes of the Keynote Demo to showcase how designers and a developers work together to achieve outstanding results. In this presentation, we'll identify the gap between designers and developers, and walk you through an actual example of how to build bridges that increase trust in your products. You'll learn about: - UX basics - Design within open source communities - Understanding the problems between developers and designers - The advantages (and disadvantages) of working with a designer - Coping with common pitfalls and false assumptions - Specific CSS and JS techniques used during the Keynote demo visualization You'll leave knowing that UX goes beyond the UI, with a better understanding of why working with a designer is important, and how to work together successfully.
    speaker: Andres Galante, Red Hat & Brian Leathem, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat
  - title: "Meet the assertable Chaos Monkeys for your Docker system"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
    abstract: The production system has been targeted by troublesome random failures over a long period of time, and countless hours of debugging has yielded no valuable results. We're close to throwing in the towel. An army of Chaos Monkeys has been deployed in an attempt to force the issue, but no solution is in sight. We need to take back control. It's time to meet the Assertable Chaos Monkey, Arquillian Cube Q. Arquilian Cube Q is an extension that gives you full control over a production-like system right from the comfort of your IDE. In this session, we'll explore some of the things you can do when you have control over the whole system. We'll validate scalability and connectivity, assert the failure state, enforce service responses, and more.
    speaker: Aslak Knutsen, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat & Bartosz Majsak, Atos Consulting Switzerland
  - title: "Developing with OpenShift without the build waits"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
    abstract: As application systems move to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments and every source code change results in a full build, a simple change can easily take minutes. This is much longer than developers are willing to wait to verify a change. And working in the cloud shouldn't mean loss of control and visibility into how an application is working. In this session, we'll cover how OpenShift by Red Hat works closely with Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to let you push code directly to a container, see your changes as you make them, debug live in deployment, and much more.
    speaker: Peter Larsen, Sr. Solutions Architect, Red Hat 
  - title: "An introduction to Eclipse Che: A next-generation Java IDE"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
    abstract: What happens when on-demand workspaces powered by Docker are transformed into a new kind of Java IDE accessed through your browser? This session introduces Eclipse Che and shows how a cloud IDE can make developing Java projects fast and powerful. We'll compare Intellisense, content assist, machines, plug-in architecture, and performance when compared to traditional desktop IDEs. Che includes numerous forms of refactoring and uses Docker to initiate environments and machines to build and run code. We'll also cover Maven, Ant, and Gradle extensions and discusses how Che can be extended with custom code templates, Dockerfiles, and plug-ins (authored in Java, of course). Additionally, Che has a Kubernetes and OpenShift plug-in, which provides duality of environments between development and production, all structured on container topologies. We'll discuss how developers are marrying their code with containers and keeping those topologies synchronized between different environments, and the role that IDEs must play in this world.
    speaker: Tyler Jewell, CEO, Codenvy
  - title: "Learning from astronauts how to be better developers"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
    abstract: As developers, we're constantly trying to improve the way we build systems and work as a team. Agile, DevOps, and Lean are all frameworks to help us be better developers and write better systems, but it still seems to be a constant struggle. Commander Chris Hadfield is a bona fide astronaut, test pilot, and rocket scientist, and he commanded the International Space Station for 3 months, making waves back on earth with his cover of Bowie’s Space Oddity. On returning, he wrote a book about everything he learned on his journey to becoming an astronaut. You’d be surprised by how much of it applies to application development. Application development should be easy—it ain't rocket science. In this session, you'll learn: - How Russia represents DevOps and Lean development, while America represents the waterfall method - How to create robust systems by thinking, “What could kill me next?” - How astronauts make amazing teams, and how to apply that in our own environments
    speaker: Sam Atkinson, Senior Development Specialist, HSBC
  - title: "Putting the 'M' in MBaaS—Red Hat mobile client development platform"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
    abstract: When you hear the term "MBaaS," or "Red Hat Mobile," there is usually a lot of discussion about powerful scaling, back-end integrations, hosting options, containerization, etc. However, we can't forget what that "M" stands for, and why the platforms exist in the first place, which is to develop and deliver top-notch mobile applications to your users. In this session, we'll review what makes all of this possible—client SDKs, hybrid solutions like Cordova, and Xamarin, and our own Build Farm and Unified Push server. Not stopping there, our AppForms support makes it a snap to tie in back-end systems all the way to your app. And this is all backed by various templates, guides, and new open source resources that will help you get started and join the fun.
    speaker: Jay Balunas, Red Hat Inc.
  - title: "Agile is a four-letter word"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
    abstract: Based on a wide variety of surveys taken over recent years, many companies are transitioning to something that looks more like Agile than the processes they were using in previous years. However, that transition doesn’t necessarily mean implementations have been done respectfully of the Agile Manifesto and the principles behind it. In large part, industry trends seem to indicate that the sloganization of the word has done a significant disservice to the ideas that were originally founded in 2001. To add even more pain, most people seem to be entirely unaware of the core basis of Agile which is the idea to embrace change but inspect and adapt to that change. Are we lost as an industry? Is there anyway we can recover from this problem? In this session, attendees can expect to engage in a conversation about the rise of the Agile community, the negative and positive impact it has had on the industry, and how you individually can help your organizations and teams lower the risk of encountering the negative problems, and speed your way towards the positives. Topics will include: - The intentions behind agile - Ways you can rework or improve your not so great agile situation - Things you should avoid from the start
    speaker: Jen Krieger, Chief Agile Architect, Red Hat
  - title: "Java 9 modularity in action"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
    abstract: "Java 9 comes to your doorstep with major changes for all of us, whether we ordered it or not. Modularity is the big theme of the Java 9 release, and it requires rethinking how we structure, build, and run Java applications. This is great, because who doesn't like more reliable and secure applications, meanwhile killing the dreaded classpath? Additionally, Java 9 has several other smaller, but useful, features, including support for HTTP 2 and collection factory methods. In this session, we'll dive deep into the module system and other new features. We'll review the basic concepts of modules and explore modularity patterns to enhance your design and development skills, and see examples of what else to expect in Java 9. We'll give plenty examples in this practical and code-driven presentation. You'll be ready for Java 9 before you know it."
    speaker: Paul Bakker, Software architect, Luminis Technologies & Sander Mak, Luminis Technologies
  - title: "A quick guide to .NET development on Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
    date: MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
    abstract: "The partnership between Red Hat and Microsoft brings new possibilities for application development and deployment. .NET has long been the application platform for Microsoft developers, and for the first time it is now available to Red Hat Enterprise Linux users. In this session, we'll gently introduce .NET development, showing you the primary components and how they can be used to develop applications of your own. We'll also introduce Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Microsoft Azure, and discuss the application development process and usage of the tools essential for .NET applications. You'll leave with all you need to begin writing simple .NET applications using Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Microsoft Azure."
    speaker: Rick Wagner, Principal Software Maintenance Engineer, Red Hat
  - title: "Open source IoT gateway: A tale of Eclipse Kura, Apache Camel, and Rhiot"
    date: TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.
    abstract: "The Internet Of Things (IoT) brings the whole new challenges to the world of the messaging solutions. Gathering data from the field and delivering it to the cloud is a common task for IoT solutions. Developers find themselves struggling with field protocols on one side and data delivery protocols on the other. Eclipse Kura is a well-recognized field gateway for IoT applications. Apache Camel is a message-routing engine and a library containing a gazillion various endpoint connectors. And last, but not least, Rhiot project attempts to make the Kura and Camel developer experience even better. In this session, you'll learn how Red Hat combines Kura, Camel, and Rhiot to create rocking IoT gateway solutions."

  - title: "Analyzing Java applications using Thermostat"
    date: TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.
    abstract: "Ever wondered how your Java application is actually working? How it's making use of scarce resources on your machine? Ever tried to look under the hood of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and felt lost with various tools that don't provide an overall picture, only local details? Thermostat is an open source serviceability tool to help Java developers understand what's happening inside the JVM when their programs are running. Thermostat collects and combines information from various sources—including the Hotspot JVM—to present a complete picture of how the application is behaving. In this session, you'll get a chance to see Thermostat in action as it's used to examine various Java applications, identify what's wrong and fix those problems—often without even modifying the application code. You'll also learn how to add more features to Thermostat through plug-ins. If you're a developer, sysadmin, or QA, and if there's Java in your technology stack, you'll want to learn how Thermostat can make your life easier."
    speaker: Omair Majid, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat
  - title: "Container development for command line developers"
    date: TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.
    abstract: "The container development kit (CDK) provides an on-ramp to building container-based applications by simplifying the configuration and set up of Linux container development environments. One of most talked about use cases is how developers can continue using Eclipse as their IDE, and with the help of Eclipse-docker tooling, utilize the Docker or OpenShift services running in the CDK for container-based development. However the CDK isn't just for Eclipse-based developers. Containers are for everyone and so is the CDK. In this session, we'll show you how to use the CDK to develop for OpenShift and/or Docker+Kubernetes, using command line tools, alternative IDEs, and in a completely virtualized manner. You'll learn: - How to configure your environment, obtain the client tools, and put them to use - Key ideas for integrating with other development environments - To make your development teams ready to work on containers No matter what desktop solution you're using—Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or any other Linux variant—your container development can be enabled with the CDK."
